- Xcode Command-Line Tools:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
- homebrew
```bash
# Looks scary, but seems to do the trick
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

## dotfiles

This is configured to install and update the [following dotfiles repository](https://github.com/pegasd/dotfiles).
